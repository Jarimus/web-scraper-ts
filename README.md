# Course description
In this project, we'll build a [Web Crawler](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/bots/what-is-a-web-crawler/) in TypeScript! To rank well in Google Search, websites need to [internally link pages one to another](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2008/10/importance-of-link-architecture). For example, a blog post about the benefits of haircuts should probably link to my post about the best places to get haircuts.

We're going to write a TypeScript [CLI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) application that generates an "internal links" report for any website on the internet by crawling each page of the site.
